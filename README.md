# visit-maldives

My very first website. Created using mainly HTML and CSS. Additionally, I have used Bootstrap to get a help on creating a caroussels, as I wasn't familiar with JavaScript. The website is not responsive yet. I was mainly focusing on learning and practicing the basics of HTML and CSS so it is generally simple website just to get a grip on HTML and CSS.
